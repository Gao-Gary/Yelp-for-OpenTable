This is a simple Chrome Extension that injects Yelp reviews into the corresponding OpenTable listing, using the Yelp Fusion API.

It requires a valid authorization bearer key in the headers, there is currently a placeholder key in the committed code. 

At the time of writing, it works for restaurants that use only English letters in their name.
Your results may vary otherwise if the restaurant name contains special characters.
